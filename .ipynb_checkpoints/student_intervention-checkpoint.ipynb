    "#### SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "- This algorithm (as many others) is currently used by a lot of companies on many tasks that involves supervised classification or regression. A real world application can vary from [classifying high resolution satellite image](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/63248/files/TPD_Karlsson.pdf), [object recognition for autonomous vehicles](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2015/170_report.pdf) to [text categorization](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/publications/joachims_98a.pdf).\n",
    "- SVM's are good for domains where there is a clear margin of separation within the data. Also, according to [this](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~mlittman/courses/ml04/svm.pdf) power point, SVM's are good because training is relatively easy compared to other models (such as neural networks), it can accept non-traditional data such as strings and trees (instead of feature vectors) and the trade-off between classifier complexity and error can be controlled explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVM's are not so good for large data sets because they don't perform so well, also, they are not very good in a very noisy dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Another point that could be counted either as a weakness and as a strenght is the fact that you need a kernel function. It is a weakness because there is an extra layer of complexity needed in order to get the model generalizing well. But, it could also be seen as a strenght since it allows a way for the business logic to be embeded into the learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to know which algorithms to use, I decided to simulate them all on the data at hand before diving into searching about each specific algorithm. While doing the tests I noticed that SVM's scored the best on the testing set, and had a pretty high trainig score as well when we were using 300 data points. In addition of that, I thought there could be a clear margin of separation within the data that could be found by SVM. Also, since the data is not large at all, SVM will tend to perform really well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "- One real world application of this algorithm is the classifications of documents as described on [ this article](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~rocha/teaching/2011s2/mc906/aulas/naive-bayes-classifier.pdf). Also, there are people who use this technique to [filter spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering). \n",
    "\n",
    "- This is a simple algorithm that generalizes well to cases where you don't have an enormous amount of data. It will also perform well even if the Naive Bayes assumption doesn't hold, and it will perform even better if it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Its main disadvantage is that it can't interact between features. Therefore, it wouldn't be able to learn that even though a student that had problems at home or didn't have internet werent likely to need guidance, a student with both would.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This model was chosen only after I plotted the learning curves for all the algorithms, and noticed that the Gaussian Naive Bayes was the only one whose curve started low when dealing with 100 datapoints, but gradually grew from a score of 0.4 to about ~0.75 as the number of points grew. Also, in addition to generalizing better to a larger dataset, this model seemed to reduce variance, since both testing and training curves tended to approach each other. In addition of that, I wanted to investigate how a model that does not take into consideration the relationship between features would behave on this dataset, to find out if the relationship between the features mattered in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "- One real world application of knn is [facial recognition](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~ramtin/ICSPCS/ICSPCS'07/papers/198.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "- KNN deals nicely with noisy training data and is effective if the training data is large. The cost of the learning process is zero, since you will get the nearest neighbours to the new instance point. \n",
    "\n",
    "- KNN tends to have a lot of bias through locality (near points are similar), smoothness (averaging) and equally weighting each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition to the points menitoned above, KNN also has a point that can be considered as both, weakness and strength. Which is the fact that you need to compute a distance function, in which case, it increases the complexity of the model to generalize well to the data. But also, gives the opportunity to compute the business logic related to the problem itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "- KNN was also chosen due to the analyisis done by plotting the learning curves of each of the algorithms listed below. When analyzing the curve, it seemed to maintain a good distance between the training and testing curves throughout all different size variations of the data points. Also, after plotting the complexity of a few models, I could notice that if `k` of KNN was changed to 30, it would generalize better and produce some of the best results of all the models tested. In addition of that, I also wanted to see if the similarities found between the features had a high impact on the model's results after all, and since KNN largely rely on the similarities between features to make its predictions, I thought it would be a good candidate for this problem."
